# GenAI

This is the repo where I put my experiments in Agentic AI, RAGs, etc.
Basically a sandbox for smolagents, Langchain stuff, etc.

1- first_agent.py
Well, my... first agent. 
Implementation of a CodeAgent in smolagents, and gradio locally (127:0:0:1)
You need to put in a hidden .env your API keys for the free-tier Gemini, OpenAI, Mistral models.
This thing's goal is to give you the current local time in various locations of the world.
